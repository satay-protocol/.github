# Satay Finance

Satay Finance is an all-in-one DeFi portfolio management tool offering three interconnected products:

1. **Blocks** - composable DeFi primitive operations through trusted third-party protocols
2. **Strategies** - compositions of Blocks that facilitate multi-protocol yield generation
3. **Vaults** - secure capital pools that optimize allocations to Blocks and Strategies to maximize yield

# Blocks

# Strategies

Satay Strategies are compositions of Blocks that enable complex yield generation in one click. Users can deposit into Strategies directly or indirectly through Vaults. The following Strategies are currently in development:

# Vaults

Satay Vaults are secure capital pools that optimize allocations to Strategies to maximize yield while limiting risk. Users can deposit into Vaults for seamless, broad exposure to the Movement DeFi ecosystem.
